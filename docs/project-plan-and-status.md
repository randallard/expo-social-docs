# Social Event Platform: Project Plan & Status

This document serves as a living record of our project plan, current status, and progress towards completing the Social Event Platform mobile application.

## Current Status

**Phase**: Planning & Setup (Initial Architecture Design)  
**Current TDD Phase**: RED - Writing initial test structure for authentication service  
**Last Updated**: May 22, 2025

## Project Vision

To create a mobile social platform that allows users to participate in flexible events, earn achievements, build social connections, and engage in real-time community activities with comprehensive gamification features.

## Development Approach

This project follows **Test Driven Development (TDD)** principles with a **Red-Green-Refactor** workflow:

1. **Red**: Write a failing test that defines the expected behavior
2. **Green**: Write the minimal code needed to make the test pass
3. **Refactor**: Improve the code quality while maintaining passing tests *(CURRENT PHASE)*

We've established a **React Native testing strategy** with:
- **Jest**: For unit testing of services and utilities
- **React Native Testing Library**: For component testing
- **Detox**: For end-to-end testing (Phase 2+)

We will commit to making the smallest possible code changes with each iteration, ensuring:
- Every feature is thoroughly tested before implementation
- Code remains clean, maintainable, and follows React Native best practices
- Technical debt is minimized through continuous refactoring
- Development progress is measurable through test coverage

### Cross-Functional Team Methodology

We've adopted a flexible team structure with:

1. **Area Leads**: Specialist leaders in frontend, backend, design, and QA
2. **Flexible Assignment**: Team members move between areas based on project needs
3. **Knowledge Sharing**: Regular cross-training and code reviews across disciplines
4. **Collaborative Planning**: Sprint planning involves all team members regardless of specialty

This methodology ensures we maintain expertise while avoiding silos and bottlenecks.

## User Stories

We've created a comprehensive set of [user stories]({{ '/docs/user-stories' | relative_url }}) to guide our development process. Key user stories include:

### Authentication
- **As a user, I want to log into the app with my credentials so that I can access my personalized account and data.**

### Achievement System
- **As a user, I want to earn achievement badges when I complete certain milestones or activities so that I feel recognized for my accomplishments.**
- **As a user, I want to view all my earned achievement badges in one place so that I can see my progress and achievements over time.**

### Social Sharing
- **As a user, I want to share my achievements and highlights to my social media accounts so that I can celebrate my accomplishments with my broader network.**

### Friend Connections
- **As a user, I want to invite friends to connect with me on the app so that we can share our experiences and stay engaged together.**
- **As a user, I want to view a list of all my connected friends so that I can easily see who I'm connected with and access their profiles.**

### Social Discovery
- **As a user, I want to view my friends' achievement badges and highlights so that I can celebrate their accomplishments and stay motivated by their progress.**

### Notifications
- **As a user, I want to receive push notifications about relevant events so that I stay informed about opportunities to participate and don't miss important activities.**

### Event Management
- **As a user, I want to start new events so that I can organize activities and invite others to participate.**
- **As a user, I want to join existing events that interest me so that I can participate in activities with other users.**

These user stories are prioritized to ensure we focus on the most important features first for each development phase.
