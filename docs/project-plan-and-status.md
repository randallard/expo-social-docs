# Social Event Platform: Project Plan & Status

This document serves as a living record of our project plan, current status, and progress towards completing the Social Event Platform mobile application.

## Current Status

**Phase**: Planning & Setup (Initial Architecture Design)  
**Current TDD Phase**: RED - Writing initial test structure for authentication service  
**Last Updated**: May 22, 2025

## Project Vision

To create a mobile social platform that allows users to participate in flexible events, earn achievements, build social connections, and engage in real-time community activities with comprehensive gamification features.

## Development Approach

This project follows **Test Driven Development (TDD)** principles with a **Red-Green-Refactor** workflow:

1. **Red**: Write a failing test that defines the expected behavior
2. **Green**: Write the minimal code needed to make the test pass
3. **Refactor**: Improve the code quality while maintaining passing tests *(CURRENT PHASE)*

We've established a **React Native testing strategy** with:
- **Jest**: For unit testing of services and utilities
- **React Native Testing Library**: For component testing
- **Detox**: For end-to-end testing (Phase 2+)

We will commit to making the smallest possible code changes with each iteration, ensuring:
- Every feature is thoroughly tested before implementation
- Code remains clean, maintainable, and follows React Native best practices
- Technical debt is minimized through continuous refactoring
- Development progress is measurable through test coverage

### Cross-Functional Team Methodology

We've adopted a flexible team structure with:

1. **Area Leads**: Specialist leaders in frontend, backend, design, and QA
2. **Flexible Assignment**: Team members move between areas based on project needs
3. **Knowledge Sharing**: Regular cross-training and code reviews across disciplines
4. **Collaborative Planning**: Sprint planning involves all team members regardless of specialty

This methodology ensures we maintain expertise while avoiding silos and bottlenecks.

## User Stories

We've created a comprehensive set of [user stories]({{ '/docs/user-stories' | relative_url }}) to guide our development process. Key user stories include:

### Authentication
- **As a user, I want to log into the app with my credentials so that I can access my personalized account and data.**

### Achievement System
- **As a user, I want to earn achievement badges when I complete certain milestones or activities so that I feel recognized for my accomplishments.**
- **As a user, I want to view all my earned achievement badges in one place so that I can see my progress and achievements over time.**

### Social Sharing
- **As a user, I want to share my achievements and highlights to my social media accounts so that I can celebrate my accomplishments with my broader network.**

### Friend Connections
- **As a user, I want to invite friends to connect with me on the app so that we can share our experiences and stay engaged together.**
- **As a user, I want to view a list of all my connected friends so that I can easily see who I'm connected with and access their profiles.**

### Social Discovery
- **As a user, I want to view my friends' achievement badges and highlights so that I can celebrate their accomplishments and stay motivated by their progress.**

### Notifications
- **As a user, I want to receive push notifications about relevant events so that I stay informed about opportunities to participate and don't miss important activities.**

### Event Management
- **As a user, I want to start new events so that I can organize activities and invite others to participate.**
- **As a user, I want to join existing events that interest me so that I can participate in activities with other users.**

These user stories are prioritized to ensure we focus on the most important features first for each development phase.

## Current Focus: Project Setup & Authentication - Red Phase

We are currently in the **Red Phase** of TDD for the authentication system setup. This involves:

1. Writing failing tests that define expected authentication behavior
2. Setting up Supabase Auth integration test structure
3. Defining authentication service interfaces
4. Creating test scenarios for login, signup, and session management

### Key Components Being Planned:

1. **Authentication Service**:
   - Supabase Auth integration
   - Session management and persistence
   - Error handling for auth failures
   - Type-safe user data handling

2. **Real-time Infrastructure Foundation**:
   - Supabase Realtime connection management
   - WebSocket connection testing strategies
   - Real-time event subscription patterns
   - Connection state management and recovery

3. **User Profile System**:
   - Basic profile creation and editing
   - Profile data validation
   - Image upload capabilities
   - Real-time profile status indicators

4. **Testing Infrastructure**:
   - Jest configuration for React Native
   - Testing Library setup for component testing
   - Mock strategies for Supabase services (including Realtime)
   - Real-time testing patterns and utilities
   - CI/CD pipeline for automated testing

### Real-time Features in MVP:

The decision to include real-time features in Phase 1 means our MVP will have engaging, live experiences from day one:

- **Live Event Updates**: See participants join events in real-time
- **Instant Achievement Celebrations**: Immediate feedback when unlocking achievements
- **Real-time Activity Indicators**: Online status and live participant counts
- **Live Event Chat**: Basic messaging within events
- **Dynamic Leaderboards**: Live updating rankings during events

This real-time foundation will make the app feel alive and engaging immediately, setting us apart from static event platforms.

Once the authentication system tests are written and failing properly, we'll move to the Green phase to implement the minimal code needed to pass tests.

## Open Questions

- What specific metrics should we track for user engagement and retention?
- How will we handle content moderation for user-generated content?
- What are our target performance benchmarks for real-time features?
- Should we implement offline functionality for core features?
- How will we handle data privacy and GDPR compliance?
- What analytics platform should we integrate for user behavior tracking?
- Should we plan for internationalization from the start?
- How will we handle app store review processes and deployment?

## Next Steps

1. Complete project setup and development environment configuration
2. Begin Red Phase for authentication service testing
3. Set up Supabase project and configure authentication
4. Implement authentication service (Green Phase)
5. Refactor authentication implementation for optimal code quality
6. Move to user profile system development
